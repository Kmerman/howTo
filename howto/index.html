  </ul>

<p>Your camera setup is EXTREMLY important, if your recording with low frames/quality you're going to have some problems...
   There are a few different kinds of quality, the most common is currently 1860p. 1860p is what you watch most movies in (depending on it's age) 720p is slightly fuzzy quality but your still able to watch and understand what's going on.
   Below 720p there is 480p, 360p, and 240p, all of which look terrible. The absolute best quality possible right now is 8K, this is way better then 1860p but much more expensive. The order goes 8K, 4K, 1860p, 720p, etc.
   When recording video you might want to record in 4k that way you don't lose any frames. The best possible video quality/frame rate combo is 4K with 120Fps.

<ul>
 <li>Clip Size</li>
 <li>Clip Audio</li>
</ul>
<!--List2-->

<p>Clip size and audio are two very important things. Viewers won't watch a 25 minute clip, they'll simply click away. You want 30-45 second attention grabbing clips to keep you're audience interested.
   Clip audio is so important because it keeps you're brain occupied while you watch! Content dictates what kind of music you should use, if your talking a lot you might now want any music but if your speeding throught the video with 4x speed you need something to pass the time.
   If you don't know whether or not to use fast/slow pace music just try both, this is the beauty of editing! Bad audio can make or break a video so just remember, if you think something needs to be changed then it does.</p>

<div id="Transitions">
<h3 class="#Transitions">Transitions</h3>
</div>

<ul>
<li>Fast Transitions</li>
<li>Interesting Content</li>
</ul>
<p>Fast transitions and interesting content are some of the more overlooked factors in video editing. Having short and interesting clips is easy enough but if they just switch instantly you're video will look choppy and unorginized.
   In order to fix this you have to add a transition! Some people like fades or dip transitions, it really just depends on what your kind of video you have.
